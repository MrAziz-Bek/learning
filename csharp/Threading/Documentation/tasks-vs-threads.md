- ***Thread***
  - Lowest-level constructs of multithreading
  - Working with threads can be challenging
  - Complicated process to return a value from a separate thread
- ***Tasks***
  - Higher-level abstraction
  - Capable of returning values
  - Can be chained
  - May use a thread pool
  - May be used for I/O bound operations
